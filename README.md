Cyber Dojo TDD solutions - Java only

## Introduction
This repository contains code solutions for problems posted in [Cyber Dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/creator/home). Cyber Dojo is a good place to solidify your TDD practice as well as your coding skill.

Most problems in Cyber Dojo are taken from [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) and therefore I will make my best effort to identify those solutions from different source: different class names, or even different branch. Not decided yet but it will be consistent.
